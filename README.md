# Sequence-to-Sequence_RNN_with_Feedback_Time-Series_using_TENSORFLOW


1.] RNN_Sequence2seq_Feature-extraction.py

This is the implementation of feature extraction algorithm technique in paper -
" Unsupervised Learning of Video Representations using LSTMs " by Nitish Srivastava, Elman Mansimov, Ruslan Salakhutdinov,
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04681.pdf 

and inspired from Uber's " Deep and Confident Prediction for Time Series at Uber " - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01907.pdf


2.] RNN_Sequence2seq_Forecasting.py

Implemented in tensorflow and 

this is inspired from - https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting/discussion/43795
